# Almost-Sorted-ALGO

This C# program checks if an array can be sorted by at most one swap or one reverse of a subarray. It compares the array to its sorted version, identifies the mismatched indices, and determines whether swapping two elements or reversing a contiguous subarray will sort it, printing "yes" with the operation or "no" if impossible.
